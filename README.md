Getting and Cleaning Data Project
==========================

Data Science Specialisation Module 3 Project Submission

Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. It makes use of the Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Project Summary

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information

You can find additional information about the data tables, transformation carried out on the data tables and the output generated in the CodeBook.MD file.
